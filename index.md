With the internet being ever present and screens surrounding us all the time,
personal preference is becoming more and more critical for a good user
experience. Particularly when it comes to dark mode in order not to burn out
the readers sight at night.

**The Darktheme Club** is a collection of web pages from across the Internet. To
qualify, your website must either use a dark theme by default, or respect the
preference of the user, preferably through the
[prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme)
media query.
